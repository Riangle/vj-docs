# Location Block 
The Location Block integrates a Google Map to display a specific location. Simply type the address and select it from the auto-suggest list. You can adjust the map's zoom level using the Options Menu.


All blocks, including Location Block, can be visually rearranged using a simple drag-and-drop interface. This allows for easy organization and customization of your content layout.
