# Reusable Blocks 
A Reusable Block can be any type of block, such as a gallery, video, or any other block you'd like to use multiple times. To make a block reusable, select the option from the Block Options Menu. You can then add this reusable block from the list whenever needed.

## Managing Reusable Blocks
Deleting a block that is created using the Reusable Blocks will not remove the associated media unless you choose to delete the entire Reusable Block from the creation modal. If you do, all related media will be permanently deleted.

All blocks, including Reusable Blocks, can be visually rearranged using a simple drag-and-drop interface. This allows for easy organization and customization of your content layout.

  <Icon name="Move" />
</StyledDataDropdownButton>

## Block Options

Each block comes with a set of features accessible through the three-dot icon located in the top right corner. This icon is visible when the block is in Edit mode, among other scenarios.

  <Icon name="EllipsisVertical" />
</StyledDataDropdownButton>

## Available Options

Depending on the block type, the options menu will vary. For example, the Location Block has a slider to adjust the map zoom level. 

<Space $xs="none" $lg={20} />

<Grid $xsCols={1} $lgCols={2}>
  <Box $title="Title" $text="Change me" href="" />
  <Box $title="Title" $text="Change me" href="" />
</Grid>
