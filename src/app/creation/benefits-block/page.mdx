# Benefits Blocks 
The Benefits Block is a versatile element that lets you showcase your company's perks and benefits in a list format. You can add as many benefits as you'd like, with each benefit requiring an icon, title, and description.

All blocks, including Benefits Blocks, can be visually rearranged using a simple drag-and-drop interface. This allows for easy organization and customization of your content layout.
