# Video Block 
The Video Block is a distinct element designed to stand out visually from other blocks. It allows you to upload videos directly from your device or embed external videos from platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.

All blocks, including Video Blocks, can be visually rearranged using a simple drag-and-drop interface. This allows for easy organization and customization of your content layout.
