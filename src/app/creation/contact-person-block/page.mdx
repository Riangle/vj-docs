# Contact Person Block 
The Contact Person Block is an element specifically designed to highlight the individual responsible for the job ad. This block allows you to include a profile image, name, and title, along with contact details such as a phone number and email address, so candidates can easily reach out.


All blocks, including Contact Person Block, can be visually rearranged using a simple drag-and-drop interface. This allows for easy organization and customization of your content layout.
