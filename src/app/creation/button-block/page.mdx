# Button Block 
The Button Block is a visually distinct element, similar to the Video Block, designed to capture attention. This block allows you to add a button that links to a specified destination, typically a form for candidates to fill out.

All blocks, including Button Blocks, can be visually rearranged using a simple drag-and-drop interface. This allows for easy organization and customization of your content layout.

## Analytics Tracking

Each click on the button is tracked, providing you with insights into how many people have applied or interacted with the button.

## Block Options

Each block comes with a set of features accessible through the three-dot icon located in the top right corner. This icon is visible when the block is in Edit mode, among other scenarios.

- Toggle between left, center, and right alignment.
- Toggle between half-width or full-width block.
- Move the block up.
