# Text Block 
The Text Block is a fundamental element that enables you to create and manage blocks of text. Within a Text Block, you have the flexibility to format content with unordered or ordered lists.

<Flex $gap={10} $wrap="nowrap">
  <StyledDataDropdownButton>
    <Icon name="ListOrdered" />
  </StyledDataDropdownButton>
  <StyledDataDropdownButton>
    <Icon name="List" />
  </StyledDataDropdownButton>
</Flex>

All blocks, including Text Blocks, can be visually rearranged using a simple drag-and-drop interface. This allows for easy organization and customization of your content layout.

<StyledDataDropdownButton>
  <Icon name="Move" />
</StyledDataDropdownButton>

## Block Options

Each block comes with a set of features accessible through the three-dot icon located in the top right corner. This icon is visible when the block is in Edit mode, among other scenarios.

<StyledDataDropdownButton>
  <Icon name="EllipsisVertical" />
</StyledDataDropdownButton>

## Available Options

Within the blockâ€™s options menu, you can:

- Toggle between half-width or full-width block.
- Move the block up.
- Move the block down.
- Make the block reusable for future use.
- Delete the block if it's no longer needed.
