# Team Account 
Your company can have unlimited management accounts, allowing multiple team members to add job ads and manage content. To enable others to contribute, they can simply [Create an Account](/create-account) and request access to your company profile.

## Request Access
To request access to your company's account:

- Go to the [Account](/account) page.
- In the Company Information section, type the name of your company and select it from the list.
- Ask the company super admin to accept your access request.

## Manage Users
As a super admin, you have the ability to accept, reject, or revoke access for any user. You can manage these permissions at the bottom of the Account page.
