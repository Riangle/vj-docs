# Job Ads 
Once you have filled your company profile, you can start posting job ads instantly. There are two ways to create a job ad:

- Click the **Plus** button always visible on the page header.
- Click the **Add Job** button from the Home page or the Company Profile.

<Grid $xsCols={1} $lgCols={2}>
  <Box $title="Company Profile" $text="Learn more about your company profile." href="/company-profile" />
  <Box $title="Job Ads" $text="Learn more about creating job ads, with all its features." href="/job-ads" />
</Grid>
