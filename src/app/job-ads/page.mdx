# Job Ads 
Once you have filled your [Company Profile](/company-profile), you can start posting job ads instantly. There are two ways to create a job ad:

<Flex $gap={20} $wrap="nowrap">
  <StyledDataArrowButton
    $isActive
    title="Add Job"
    aria-label="Add Job"
  >
   <StyledDataUserAvatar className="avatar">
      <Icon name="Plus" />
    </StyledDataUserAvatar>
  </StyledDataArrowButton>
  <Button $outline><Icon name="Plus" className="icon" />Add Job</Button>
</Flex>

- Click the **Plus** button always visible on the page header.
- Click the **Add Job** button from the Home page or the Company Profile.
