# Integrations 
The [VIDEOJOBS](https://www.videojobs.io) platform is designed with a user-centric approach, providing you with the flexibility to integrate its core features—and beyond—anywhere on the web. Whether on your company website, a job board, or social media, you can seamlessly extend the platform's capabilities.

## Embedding Options
We offer you the ability to:

- [Embed on Job Boards](/integrations/embed-on-job-boards)
- [Embed Open Positions](/integrations/embed-open-positions)
- [Embed Video Blocks](/integrations/embed-video-blocks)
- [Embed Image Blocks](/integrations/embed-image-blocks)

These elements can be embedded on any job board or website. Additionally, you have the option to share direct links to these elements, making it easy to distribute your content across various platforms.
